CHATBOT WITH RULE-BASED RESPONSES

I have build a simple chatbot that responds to user inputs based on
predefined rules. I have used if-else statements or pattern matching
techniques to identify user queries and provide appropriate
responses. This will give a basic understanding of natural 
language processing and conversation flow.
